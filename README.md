# Faceanonymization
This repo contains the code to my Computer Vision task which got me into The AlgorithmX fellowship ;)
The crux of the task was to blur all faces excpet that of Thomas Shelby. 
I used the Face Recognition module which is used to recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library. Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition. built with deep learning.

I am currenlty working on a product called VisForce, a Visibilty Reinforcement system employing Deep Learning techniques to 'de-haze' the ego vehicle's environment.
In the name of the peaky foo*%in blinders, go get 'em!!
